# Therapy Pets for Hire Mobile App (Work in Progress)

Welcome to the Therapy Pets for Hire Mobile App project! This iOS app is a work in progress aiming to provide users with access to therapy animals for hire, accompanied by a company employee, to offer comfort and companionship.

## Planned Features

- **Browse Animals**: Users will be able to browse a variety of therapy animals available for hire, including details such as name, breed, age, and suitability for different demographics.
  
- **Booking System**: The app will feature a convenient booking system where users can select dates and times to hire a therapy animal, with options to specify special requests or notes.

- **Customer Reviews**: Planned to include a testimonial section containing recommendations and reviews from previous customers.

- **Comprehensive Information**: The app will provide detailed information about each therapy animal, including environmental requirements, activities that can be done, dietary considerations, safety guidelines, and more.
